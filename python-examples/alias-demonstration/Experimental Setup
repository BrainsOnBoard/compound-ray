1 - demonstrating aliasing from lack of samples:

In the Natural Environment
Place a compound eye with various acceptance angles
Upper : Iterate through samples, the final image is a linear blending of all of these - should go from aliased on the left to clear on the right
Middle: Iterate through samples, Calculate the per-ommatidia variance, which is plotted ommatidium-wise across the linear blend of samples
Lower : Iterate through samples, calculate average per-ommatidia variance, plot average variance.
