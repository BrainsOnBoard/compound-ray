Here you'll find some example usages of the eye renderer using it's Python bindings.

`primary-example.py` provides a good overview of the process of using the eye renderer, while each subfolder represents a specific example that relates to the figures found in this paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.20.461066v1
Please note that due to the current unavailability of the 'natural' environment (also referenced here as the 'rothamsted' environment), a stand-in environment is currently in use, accessed via 'eye-renderer/data/natural-standin-sky.gltf`
