Before building, it's a good idea to familiarise yourself with the bits of the CMake build that might go wrong.

Primarily, you need to point it to your installation of NVidia OptiX.
This is done by changing the OptiX installation directory in CMake/FindOptiX.cmake - in particular, it is configured in the first non-comment line's `set` method. Simply point it at the folder containing the Optix `SDK` folder.

The program must be configured to match your GPU architecture.
`CMakeLists.txt` handles this in a few places. `CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS` and `CUDA_NVRTC_FLAGS` both store values used in compiling cuda against differing GPU architectures, and their default values might not match your own architecture.
Note the "PASSED_FIRST_CONFIGURE" value - as such a number of these are easier to configure in ccmake.


As this software is build upon the example code found in the NVidia OptiX SDK, if you can get the provided samples there compiling then a lot can be gleaned by examining the differences in the build files between your later version and those found here.



Cmake/Make deps:
libxcursor-dev, libxinerama-dev, libxrandr-dev
