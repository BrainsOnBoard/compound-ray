CompoundRay: Rendering From the Insect Perspective
==================================================

Why Build an Insect Eye Simulator At All?

The way that insects see the world differs greatly from the way we do: for instance, with their compound eyes, they can see in near full panoramic vision, meaning that they can see both what's behind them and what's in front of them at the same time.
They also see at a much lower resolution than the typical human eye - you could think of the difference between an insect's vision and our own as similar to the difference between the camera on a cameraphone from the early 2000s and a camera found on a modern mobile phone of today (and yet, even that over-estimates the visual acuity of the compound eye).

Despite the percieved lack of image quality, insects are still capable of visual feats as complex as route navigation, recognition and avoidance, with some preying insects capable of estimating the 3D position of their targets mid-flight.
All of these tasks are performed using energy orders of magnitudes smaller than that used by modern processing units when performing similar tasks using high-resolution panoramic cameras, which makes the study of the insect visual system of great interest not just to biologists, but also roboticists.
